This is a project for the Brunei AI for Good Hackathon

The main code is in app.py
For those who are wondering, main.py and generatevalues.py are places where i tested the code separetly from the flask project then later added them into the flask thing.

The actual website link to the project being deployed onto a server is http://43.245.220.12:5000/
That's where you can test the website for yourself and see what it does.

The UI is a bit bad but I think you'll get the main point. The final part is where it ranks the companies from best to worst (fake companies mind you)
